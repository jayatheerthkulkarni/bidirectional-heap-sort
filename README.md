# Sorting Algorithm Project

Welcome to my sorting algorithm project! This algorithm was designed iteratively over time, driven purely by curiosity and my love for problem solving. While this project began as a fun exploration, the final result is something I'm proud of. **The design and structure of this algorithm were completely conceptualized by me**, though I sought occasional assistance from AI to refine certain areas.

## Overview

This repository contains two key files:

1. **`sort.c`**: The final, optimized version of the algorithm, achieving a time complexity of **O(n log n)**. This version leverages multiple data structures and incorporates ideas from well-known algorithms to enhance efficiency. It represents the culmination of my learning journey and exploration of sorting techniques.

2. **`test.c`**: The original, rudimentary version of the algorithm, developed during my first exposure to sorting algorithms in class. It operates with a time complexity of **O(n²)** and serves as a testament to the early ideas I had around sorting when I first learned the concept. Despite its inefficiency, it holds sentimental value for me as it represents the foundation of this project.

## Time Complexity

- **Final Version (`sort.c`)**: O(n log n)
  - This version balances efficiency with readability, using a combination of **data structures** and **algorithmic optimizations**.
  
- **Basic Version (`test.c`)**: O(n²)
  - This was my initial attempt at implementing sorting based purely on my understanding of the concept. Though it's not optimized, it was a crucial stepping stone in the journey.

## Approach

The final algorithm in `sort.c` was developed through numerous iterations, each building on the previous version. I explored various techniques, gradually refining the process to reduce time complexity and improve overall performance. The design of this sorting method is unique to me, as I didn't follow any specific reference or guide for its development. It was more of a **hobby** than a formal research project.

Feel free to experiment with both versions and observe the differences in performance and design. I hope this project can inspire you to explore sorting algorithms, just as I did!
